ROIs in the net spectrum
========================

Similarly to what was done in the original spectrum, we now delimit
the regions in the liquid spectrum. At this step, new peaks may be
discovered that were previously hidden by the continuum, and
previously detected peaks may be discarded as artifacts arising
from statistical noise.

From here, the peaks and regions can be analyzed directly to obtain
their parameters and define fitting functions for them.
