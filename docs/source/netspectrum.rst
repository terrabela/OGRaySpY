Assembling the net spectrum
===========================

Every gamma ray spectrum inherently has features that can
be classified according to the type of physical interaction
and events sequence giving rise to them. Some of these are
Compton plateaus, backscatter peaks, annihilation peaks,
first and second escape peaks and total absorption peaks.

Although all of these features can give useful information
by different analytical techniques, here we are especially
interested in the peaks, especially the total absorption
peaks. The latter are formed by the accumulation of counts
in the events in which the energy of a single gamma photon
is entirely converted into electron kinetic energy and
then the electrons are collected by the associated
electronics in a single time window.

We then define the concept of the spectrum baseline,
or continuum, in contrast to the parcel containing the peaks
and which overlaps the continuum. For the analysis, one
essentially defines a spline-type curve for the continuum and
subtracts it from the original spectrum, resulting in the net
spectrum.
