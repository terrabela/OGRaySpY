Loading a spectrum
==================

Loading the spectrum involves reading the respective file, previously saved in some standardized format. The data read is then assembled into a common structure, independent from the source file format.

Currently, two spectrum formats can be read:

- CHN, from EG&G Ortec
- IEC, from the International Electrotechnical Commission
