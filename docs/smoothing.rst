Smoothing
=========

Smoothing the spectrum is the process by which the statistical noise of the counts is reduced in order to minimize the detection of spurious peaks in the first peak detection step.

The smoothed spectrum is kept parallel to the original spectrum, which will be used in subsequent analysis steps.
