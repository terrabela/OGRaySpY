Delimiting regions of interest
==============================

Since, in the general case, gamma peaks can have a more or less
significant overlap, the so-called regions of interest are defined.

After the preliminary detection of the peaks carried out in the
previous step, peaks that are close enough, according to some
criterion, are included in the same ROI, since the fitting of all
of peaks included in the region must be performed in a single step.
